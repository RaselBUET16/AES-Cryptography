# AES-Cryptography
It's a python code for AES cryptography for 128 bit key.It can take any length of key both in hex or ascii form.But always work by converting it into a 128bit key.

It can take plain text of any length in hex or ascii form.and encrypt it in cypher form,(both in hex and ascii)

This script can also encrypt any file(pdf , image) and encrypt it,finally after dycrypting it writes into a new file to check whether the encryption and decryption are doing well or not.
